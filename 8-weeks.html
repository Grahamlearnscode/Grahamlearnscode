<h1>Progress Marker - 8 Weeks</h1>
<p class=caption>Jan 30th, 2020</p>

<p>I’ve been doing the Odin Project full JS stack since the first week of December, for 3-5 hours per week and I felt like sharing some thoughts and progress so far.</p>   
  
<p>The course itself seems to be written and structured well. This is the longest/most consistently I’ve stuck with any kind of online course which is partly on me having a hopefully better attitude to it and partly because the course has me feeling like I’m making little bits of progress consistently.</p>
  
<p>Other things to like about it: it links to external content often (good, not everything needs to be rewritten if it already has a solid tutorial); it’s sufficiently explicit about which bits of those external sources to read/watch and which not to, which exercises to follow along with etc; it reiterates the ‘we’ll do this topic in more detail later’ or ‘you don’t need a full understanding of this right now’ philosophy where appropriate; it’s a little soon to tell but does seem geared towards practical skills over pure theory/language learning (you spend a sufficiently long time before actually writing any code that it might be off-putting to some people. I really appreciated the early focus on git, I'm not as sure about setting up a Linux VM as the first task but it’s early days yet and that might prove invaluable going forward).</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>(knowledge or skills that are new to me):
  <ul>
    <li>A very top-level eli5 understanding of how a website is created and how that's accessed later.</li>
    <li>Set up a VM.</li>
    <li> First exposure to Linux and Terminal basics.</li>
    <li> Get Git and Github up and running for a single author.</li>
    <li> Simple version control (commit changes, checkout to revert local changes).</li>
    <li> Using Chrome dev tools: inspector and computed.</li>
    <li> Create web pages locally and link them, use local stylesheets.</li>
    <li> Basic HTML and CSS to the point I could create a web page and have it look not-terrible.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>I've just finished the <a href=https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/html-css>'create a (nonfunctional) replica of the Google homepage'</a> project now. <a href=https://grahamlearnscode.github.io/google-homepage>The finished article</a> is a web page that I built, and it's on the internet. That's an achievement, right?<br>
That turned into a much bigger task than I first anticipated, I'd estimate it was 12+ hours of work for me. To be fair, part of the project brief is 'don't be a perfectionist' and I should probably have taken that on board more. On the other hand, I learned new things consistently while doing it, some of which I wouldn't have come across if I hadn't been trying for an exact replica. Display, position and when something should be in a div have been huge stumbling blocks for me in the little bit of web programming I've tried in the past, so I'm pleased with myself for breaking them down into small tasks in isolation and looking up resources. I wouldn't say I'm *comfortable* with those things yet, but I can use them and will know what I should be searching for the next time I build something and get stuck on those.</p>

<h2>Invaluable lessons I should really remember:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can't undo checking out a file from git. Be sure you really want to revert those changes before doing that.</li>
  <li>Test it in isolation. Replicate it in codepen. When it works perfectly there, you can be pretty sure you've done something wrong in the live file, or that something you're not expecting to mess with it <em>is</em> messing with it.</li>
  <li>Not working? Put a 2px solid red border round it. You understand how borders work, that'll make it pretty obvious if the problem is with the new rule you don't fully understand yet, or if you've targeted the wrong element or left a comment unclosed on the prior rule.</li>
  <li>Still not working? You've not closed a comment or forgotten a colon or you don't know which side is left and which side is right when it comes to borders and margins.</li>
  <li>Comment your progress at the top of the file. You'll be coming back to this in a day or two, make it easy to pick up.</li>
