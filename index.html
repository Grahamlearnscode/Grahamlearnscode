<h1>Welcome to GrahamLearnsCode's homepage</h1>
<p>On this page I'll be sharing my journey of learning how to program. I'll link to completed projects within my portfolio and commentary on how they went and what I've learned. I'll also be updating this site itself as I learn more and more.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>When I started on this journey at the end of 2019, I'd been working with software for around five and a half years, starting as first-line tech support but over time getting more and more involved in testing, discussing requirements and solutions to problems, user experience and all those other not-writing-code things that are the building blocks of a software business. It meant I had a reasonable understanding of how a program (and more recently, a web app) works, but aside from a small amount of digging through API responses to troubleshoot or changing a record directly inside a database, there was always a wall there blocking off the moving parts. I was like a mechanic who could change a tyre just fine, but only knew the vaguest parts of what happens inside an engine; you press the accelerator and then <em>something</em> happens and there's a driveshaft involved somehow and then the wheels turn. I think.</p>
<p>I don't want to be down on that. Everything I'm talking about there are necessary jobs and those were roles that were often fun and satisfying. But...well, I like being self-sufficient and I like making things. Two qualities that don't sit well with working closely with talented developers and not being able to inspect code, or to contribute to it. </p>

<p>And so, I started this. Committing to using my spare time to learn web development. What's the end goal? In big picture terms, a role change. In more focused terms, I'm not sure. The most consistent advice I see leans towards <em>pick a resource, pick a language and run with it</em>. Concepts and ways of thinking first. Tooling second. What do I actually want to learn in depth and get experience in working with is a question for the future. Can I stay motivated through the basics and get <em>anywhere</em> is the question for now. The answer to that, I wrote further down that same first page of notes. My mantra:</p> 
<p class="pullQuote">This will be hard. <br>But I can do it.</p>
