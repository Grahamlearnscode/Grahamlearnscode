<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>When I started on this journey at the end of 2019, I'd been working with software for around five and a half years, starting as first-line tech support but over time getting more and more involved in testing, discussing requirements and solutions to problems, user experience and all those other not-writing-code things that are the building blocks of a software business. It meant I had a reasonable understanding of how a program (and more recently, a web app) works, but aside from a small amount of digging through API responses to troubleshoot or changing a record directly inside a database, there was always a wall there blocking off the moving parts. I was like a mechanic who could change a tyre just fine, but only knew the vaguest parts of what happens inside an engine; you press the accelerator and then <em>something</em> happens and there's a driveshaft involved somehow and then the wheels turn. I think.</p>
<p>I don't want to be down on that. Everything I'm talking about there are necessary jobs and those were roles that were often fun and satisfying. But...well, I like being self-sufficient and I like making things. Two qualities that don't sit well with working closely with talented developers and not being able to inspect code, or to contribute to it. </p>

<p>And so, I started this. Committing to using my spare time to learn web development. What's the end goal? In big picture terms, a role change. In more focused terms, I'm not sure. The most consistent advice I see leans towards <em>pick a resource, pick a language and run with it</em>. Concepts and ways of thinking first. Tooling second. What do I actually want to learn in depth and get experience in working with is a question for the future. Can I stay motivated through the basics and get <em>anywhere</em> is the question for now. The answer to that, I wrote further down that same first page of notes. My mantra:</p> 
<p class="pullQuote">This will be hard. <br>But I can do it.</p>
