OUTSTANDING


FIXED

    pf-5: Heading background image too narrow, should cover screen width (with small margin)
        Added 'background-size:cover' property and margin x 5%

    pf-1: on menu hover, all other content is bumped down by 2px
    pf-2: on width resize of screen, menu icon moves around
    pf-3: on expand menu, menu text causes horizontal scroll
    pf-6: on expand menu, page content is bumped down
        Moved menu element to 'position:absolute' div within 'position:relative' heading

    pf-7: on hover menu icon within expanded menu, other menu content is bumped down slightly
        Added 3px bottom margin, which is removed on hover

    pf-4: contact icons at bottom overlap page text. Should clear
        Messed about with divs a lot. 'background:inherit' on these did it, makes it a solid background of same colour as body background.
