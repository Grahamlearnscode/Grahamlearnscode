<h1>Recipe project</h1>

<p>I'm somewhere approaching 100 hours into this coding journey. It's time to build something from scratch and discover things organically, alongside syllabus learning.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>The <span class="conversation">"What do you want for dinner tonight?"<br>"Don't know, you?"<br>"I don't know either"<br></span> conversation is something that comes up practically every day in our house. Also my partner and I are currently trying to eat healthier. So there's a need for meal planning.</p>
<p>There are of course already many resources out there to help with this. We've got a shelf full of recipe books in the kitchen. A few websites bookmarked, some subreddits I know of around meal planning etc. Yet we're still pretty terrible at regularly finding culinary inspiration, and at buying ingredients that open up new options when we do the weekly shop.</p>
<p><span class="smallPullQuote">Let's solve this problem.</span></p>
<p><em>But Graham,</em> you might be wondering, <em>why is this on your website about learning to code?</em></p>
<p>Well:
<ul><li>It'll give me one home to keep recipes and ideas that are currently spread out across various different homes</li>
    <li>If it's on my own site that I maintain, I'll probably look at it regularly
      <ul><li>'Out of sight, out of mind' holds true in my experience. I'm aiming for the opposite effect here.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>I can use technology to get exactly what I want out of it.</li> 
    And maybe most importantly:
    <li>I don't yet know what technology I could or should use to do it. So building it <em>should</em> be a great learning experience.</li></ul></p>

<h2>The spec (v1)</h2>
<p>On the homepage of my site, whenever I load it, I want to see a recipe to inspire me. I also want an option to instead see a recipe for something I've made before and enjoyed, in case I'm not in the mood to try something new.</p>

<h3>User journeys</h3>

<p>As a site user on the homepage:
  <ul><li>On page load, I see a random recipe that has not yet been made</li>
    <li>I can click a <strong>Random</strong> button to display another recipe, regardless if it's been made before</li>
    <li>I can click a <strong>New</strong> button to display another random recipe that has not yet been made</li>
    <li>I can click a <strong>Favourite</strong> button to display a recipe that has previously been made and rated as good</li>
    <li>I can click a <strong>View All</strong> button to be taken to the collection of recipes</li></ul></p>

    <p>As a site user maintaining the collection of recipes:
  <ul><li>I can add details of a new recipe
      <ul><li>This could be text, an image, or a link to external content</li></ul>
  </li>
      <li>I can delete an existing recipe</li>
      <li>I can edit an existing recipe</li></ul></p>

<p>As a site user viewing a recipe:
  <ul><li>I can mark a recipe as <strong>Made</strong></li>
      <li>I can mark a Made recipe as <strong>Good, would make again</strong> or <strong>Nah, didn't love it</strong></li>
      <li>I can edit the recipe</li>
      <li>I can add a note to the recipe</li></ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Limitations</h3>
  <ul><li>There's no requirement at this stage for multiple users to have a different experience. State and rating of a recipe is tied to the recipe as a whole, not to any single person's making/rating of it.</li></ul>

  <h2>The tech (v1)</h2>
  <ul><li>Front end: HTML elements styled with CSS</li>
    <li>Interactivity: The moving parts will be handled with Javascript</li>
    <li>Objects/records: TBD
      <ul><li>The spec makes it clear that recipes will have properties like 'made' and 'rating', so in some sense we're talking about a collection of records here. For those alone, JS Objects might be sufficient.</li>
      <li>Long-term a collection records may be better served by a database; I've got some experience querying and maintaining existing databases but none in creating one. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it; it might be possible with a small number of records and properties to manage this purely in HTML/CSS/JS.</li></ul>
    </li></ul>
