//This was part of the Odin Project's introduction to test-driven development. I kept it around because after a bunch of exercises where I really had to iterate my way through a bunch of fails and ended up with something pretty messy, I nailed the requirements on this one first time. And I *think* this is the most efficient way of writing this function.1
//1 Well. I didn't actually look up order of operations for the && and || check. The parentheses could be unnecessary. But even if that's the case, I'd leave them in for readability.
