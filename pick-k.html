<h1>Pick K</h1>

    <p>
       This was a problem I saw posted on the /r/learnprogramming subreddit. A self-taught dev had been given this as part of their first technical interview. It seemed doable at my level (though other things they were asked during the interview are beyond me right now) so I thought I'd take a swing at it.  
    </p>
        
    <h2>The problem</h2>

    <p>Given an array of distinct n numbers, randomly pick k distinct numbers from the list. You are only given k chances to pick the number. You are not allowed to have temporary storage (like another list).

        <br><br>
        e.g. [1,6,5,3] n=4 k=2
        <br>
        result [1,6] or [1,5] or [5,6] etc</p>

        <h2>Let's decompose the problem...</h2>
        <ul><li>Choose a random position p of an array
            <ul><li>Choose a random number between 1 and n</li></ul>
        </li>
            <li>Retrieve the number at position p</li>
            <li>Amend an array to remove a number at a specified position</li>
            <li>Add the removed number to a new array k
            <li>Loop all of this k times</li></ul>


    <h2>My solution</h2>

    <img src="images/pick-k.png" alt="screenshot of the function in an IDE. This function is also available as inline javascript on this page." style="margin-top:10px;">

    <p>It's running on this page, open dev tools and check the console. You can also call the function by typing <code>pickK([x], k)</code> into the console, where <em>x</em> is the array.


    <script>

        const pickK = function(array, k) {      
        let i = k;
        k=[];

        //loop all of this k times
        for (i; i>0; i--) {
            //choose a random number between 1 and n (actually 0 and n-1)
            p = Math.floor(Math.random()*array.length); 

            // array[p] //Retrieve the number at position p
            
            k.push( //add the removed number to a new array k
                parseInt(array.splice(p,1))); //Amend an array to remove a number at a specified position   
        }
        console.log('array is now ', array);
        console.log('k is ', k);
        return k;
    }

    k=pickK ([1,3,5,9,7], 3);  //returns k as an array containing 3 distinct numbers from the original array



    </script>
