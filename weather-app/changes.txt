Changes I made following completion of the netninja weather app project:

1) Move index.html into my website's parent directory, rename as weather-app.html
1a) Required references to be updated for stylesheet and scripts
1b) Bugs: weather icon and day/night graph not loading. References updated. Fixed.

2) City form automatically selects the first result from Accuweather's city search API. This may not always be the user's intended location. To mitigate, I added display of additional geographic details: country, and if in a 'State' or 'Province' administrative region, the State/Provide code.

3) The day/night graphic gives a good read on the broad time of day, but is more meaningful when local time is also displayed. I should add a Date object hh:mm next to the country.
